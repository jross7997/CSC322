# The Calculator Lab (Lab 1):
A basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides floating point numbers. Also performs the Collatz conjecture on integers

This is a basic calculator, it can add, subtract, multiply, and divide floating point numbers. It also shows the Collatz conjecture positive integers.

Division:\
	div float float\
Collatz Conjecture:\
	col int 

The collatz function does not display the sequence Recieved a 18/20

# The Shell Lab:
Built our own shell from scratch using C.

We only wrote the tsh.c file. Everything else was provided for testing purposes
